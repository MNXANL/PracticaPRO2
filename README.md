#Practica PRO2 QT 2015/2016
How do I run it?

	Download this repo using "git clone [Repo_Link]". Then, access the folder /Code 
	and write "make". To run the program, write "./program.exe".

I don't understand anything! Where's the documentation?

	Documentation can be found on the folder DOC. It has versions on both LaTeX and HTML.
	Because the subject was done in catalan, it's written in said language.

Made by Miguel Moreno and Jaime Arroyo for the subject "Programming 2" (PRO2) in FIB (UPC, Barcelona) on the autumn course, year 2015.

Mark for this project was 8/10, that is: the code works perfectly, but it has several inconsistencies in regards to modular design and some fragments of the code aren't as efficient (both in time and space) as it could be.
